Day 29/100 of Code: Building My Portfolio Website! ðŸ”¥

Today, I worked on creating my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my:
âœ… Skills & Expertise
âœ… Projects (AI, Full Stack, Game Development)
âœ… Contact & Social Links

I believe a portfolio is more than just a webpageâ€”itâ€™s a reflection of my journey and a bridge to new opportunities! ðŸš€

Next Steps:
ðŸ”¹ Add Dark/Light Mode
ðŸ”¹ Improve UI/UX with animations
ðŸ”¹ Host it online for easy access

Excited to keep growing! Whatâ€™s your favorite portfolio feature? Letâ€™s discuss! ðŸ‘‡
