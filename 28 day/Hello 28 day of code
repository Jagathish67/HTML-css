Day 28 of #100DaysOfCode – Coding with a Sweet Tooth! 🍫✨
Today’s project was extra special because I combined my love for coding & desserts into a beautifully animated Ice Cream & Cake Shop website! 🍨🎂

💖 Why I Loved This:
🎨 Designing with passion makes coding feel like art!
🍰 Cakes & Ice Cream aren’t just treats—they inspire creativity!
✨ Animations & colors bring websites to life in a magical way.

🍦🍰 What I Built Today:
✅ Dreamy UI with smooth hover & scroll animations
✅ Glassmorphism effects for a soft, modern look
✅ Fun, interactive menu showcasing 10 Ice Creams & 10 Cakes
✅ Glowing buttons & floating effects for a playful feel

💡 Next Up:
🛒 Making it a real e-commerce experience with a shopping cart!
